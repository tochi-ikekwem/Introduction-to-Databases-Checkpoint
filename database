Slide 2: Introduction to MongoDB
What is MongoDB?
A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON).
Designed for scalability and performance.
Schema-less, allowing for dynamic data structures.
Key Features:
Supports rich data types (arrays, objects).
High availability through replica sets.
Horizontal scalability with sharding.
Slide 3: Introduction to SQL Databases
What are SQL Databases?
Relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for data management and manipulation.
Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
Key Features:
Fixed schema with predefined table structures.
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance for transactions.
Strong relational capabilities with JOIN operations.
Slide 4: Comparison of MongoDB and SQL Databases
Table
Feature	MongoDB	SQL Databases
Data Model	Document-oriented (JSON-like)	Table-based, row-oriented
Schema	Dynamic (flexible)	Fixed (predefined)
Scalability	Horizontal (sharding)	Vertical (add resources to a server)
Transactions	Supports multi-document ACID transactions but historically weaker (improved in recent versions)	Strong ACID compliance for transactions
Query Language	MongoDB Query Language (MQL)	SQL (Structured Query Language)
Slide 5: Use Cases and Conclusion
When to Use MongoDB:
Applications requiring rapid development and iteration.
When dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Real-time analytics and high volume web applications (e.g., social networks, IoT).
When to Use SQL Databases:
Applications requiring complex transactions (e.g., financial systems, ERP).
When data integrity and relationstional data model are crucial.
Situations with predefined and stable schemas.
Conclusion:
Both MongoDB and SQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses.
The choice depends on application requirements, data structure, and scaling needs.
Notes for Your Presentation:
Design Tips:
Use visuals such as charts or diagrams to illustrate the differences.
Add icons or images relevant to each database type for better engagement.
Ensure the text is easily readable (consider font size and background contrast).
Presentation Style:
Maintain eye contact and engage with your audience.
Encourage questions at the end to clarify any points of confusion.
Provide real-world examples or scenarios to illustrate your points more vividly.
